      <h1>A Beautiful tiger splashing through the water</h1>
    <img src="images/tigerinwater.jpg" alt="Beautiful tiger galloping through the water">
    <p>This is my first paragraph that I am writing as an assignment in MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) to augment the building of my first webpage. I am auditing CS-142 with Professor Mendel Rosenblum. I sat in on 3 or 4 of his class sessions last quarter and enjoyed his nonchalant, consistent teaching style.</p>
    <p>Since I am adding a list, I might as well talk TIGERS. Tigers can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>jump</li>
        <li>roar</li>
        <li>and of course, SPLASH</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I look forward to completing all his lectures (via reviewing his notes at the class website on an at least weekly pace).  I also look forward to completing all (or at least most) of the class assigned projects.</p>
    <p>Lastly, more tiger talk.</p>
